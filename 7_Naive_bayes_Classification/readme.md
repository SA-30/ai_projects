# Naive Bayes Classification - Simplified Implementation

### This notebook demonstrates Naive Bayes Classification using three variants:

1. Gaussian Naive Bayes - For continuous data
2. Multinomial Naive Bayes - For text classification
3. Bernoulli Naive Bayes - For binary features


### Simple Workflow: Each example follows the same structure:

- Load/prepare data
- Split into train/test
- Train model
- Make predictions
- Evaluate and visualize results
